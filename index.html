                    <p class="lead mb-5">
                        My name is Cru Andreasen. I am 22 years old and pursuing a marketing major at BYU. When I heard about the opportunity for the Medical sales internship, it became a primary focus for me. I am confident that it will greatly benefit my future career. I have always been scientifically minded, and my natural strengths draw me to work with people. I believe this internship would be an excellent opportunity to grow those strengths and learn how to apply them in the business world.
                        In addition to the logistical reasons for wanting this position, I have personal reasons as well. In 2019, I was diagnosed with keratoconus. Without the treatment your company developed, I would have gone completely blind by the end of that year. However, thanks to your life-saving innovations, not only can I still see, but I was also able to see well enough to play on BYU’s national championship-winning lacrosse team in 2024. I believe my skills and experiences give me a unique perspective and drive to succeed in this internship.

                    <p>I am the oldest of four children and grew up in what we called "the mullet house" – city life in the front, country life in the back. On our land, we raised four pack goats, which we love to take backpacking. I am also an avid climber and snowboarder. Exploring new experiences has always been a passion of mine, and it reached new heights when I met my Wife. Together, we work hard to improve our hobbies and explore new ones, such as painting and mountain biking. Relationships are essential to me, and combined with rich experiences, they make life not just manageable but exciting at every turn.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors spend as much time as I can learning and being creative. From trying out new board games to painting and other forms of art. Since being married I have also tried my hand at cooking and baking!</p>
